This is the demo page for the paper titled “Source Separation-Based Data Augmentation Techniques For Improved Joint Beat And Downbeat Tracking In Classical Music ”.


## Abstract
Beat/downbeat tracking have been fundamental and important topics in music information retrieval research. Though deep learning-based models have achieved great success for music with stable and clear beat positions, it remains quite challenging for classical music in the absence of a steady drum sound. In this paper, we propose a novel source separation-based data augmentation technique that is tailored for beat/downbeat tracking in classical music. This involves a model that separates drum and non-drum sounds, and mechanisms to perform drum stem selection. We report comprehensive experiments validating the usefulness of the proposed methods.
